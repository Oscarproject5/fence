# üîê Security Implementation

This document outlines all security measures implemented in the RGV Fencing website.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### 1. Security Headers
Located in `next.config.js`, these headers protect against common web vulnerabilities:

- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Forces HTTPS connections
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Prevents cross-site scripting attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Controls resource loading
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser features
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information

### 2. Rate Limiting
Implemented at multiple levels to prevent abuse:

#### Middleware Level (`middleware.ts`)
- Limits: 10 requests per minute per IP
- Applies to all API routes
- Returns 429 status when exceeded

#### API Level (`app/api/contact/route.ts`)
- Additional limit: 5 form submissions per hour per IP
- Prevents spam and abuse

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
Located in `lib/security.ts`:

- **HTML Escaping**: Prevents XSS attacks
- **Input Sanitization**: Removes dangerous characters
- **Format Validation**:
  - Email validation (RFC compliant)
  - Phone number validation (US format)
  - Name validation (letters, spaces, hyphens only)
  - Address validation (alphanumeric + common punctuation)
- **Length Limits**: Prevents buffer overflow
- **Character Filtering**: Removes control characters

### 4. Bot Protection

#### Honeypot Fields
- Hidden fields that only bots would fill
- Located in both form components
- Submissions with filled honeypots are silently rejected

#### Time-Based Validation
- Tracks when form was loaded
- Rejects if submitted too quickly (< 3 seconds)
- Effective against automated bots

#### Spam Detection
- Pattern matching for common spam content
- Checks for excessive capitalization
- URL detection in messages

### 5. CORS Protection
- Restricts API access to your domain in production
- Prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests

### 6. Environment Variable Security
- Sensitive keys kept in environment variables
- Never exposed in client-side code
- `.env.local` excluded from version control

## üö® Attack Prevention

### Protected Against:

‚úÖ **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- Input sanitization
- Content Security Policy
- HTML escaping

‚úÖ **SQL Injection**
- No direct database queries
- Input validation
- Parameterized queries (if database added)

‚úÖ **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- SameSite cookies
- Origin validation
- CORS headers

‚úÖ **Clickjacking**
- X-Frame-Options header
- Frame-ancestors CSP directive

‚úÖ **Bot Attacks**
- Honeypot fields
- Time-based validation
- Rate limiting

‚úÖ **Spam**
- Pattern detection
- Rate limiting
- Input validation

‚úÖ **DDoS Attempts**
- Rate limiting at multiple levels
- Request throttling
- IP-based blocking capability

## üìä Monitoring & Logging

### What's Logged:
- Failed validation attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Honeypot triggers
- Spam detection hits
- Form submission metadata

### Where to Find Logs:
- **Development**: Browser console & terminal
- **Production**: Vercel Functions logs

## üîß Configuration

### Adjusting Security Settings:

#### Rate Limits
Edit in `middleware.ts`:
```typescript
const MAX_REQUESTS_PER_WINDOW = 10 // Adjust this
const RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW = 60 * 1000 // 1 minute
```

Edit in `app/api/contact/route.ts`:
```typescript
const MAX_REQUESTS_PER_IP = 5 // Adjust this
const TIME_WINDOW = 60 * 60 * 1000 // 1 hour
```

#### Spam Detection
Edit patterns in `lib/security.ts`:
```typescript
const spamPatterns = [
  // Add new patterns here
]
```

#### Bot Detection Time
Edit in `lib/security.ts`:
```typescript
const minimumSeconds = 3 // Minimum time to fill form
```

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Set strong Web3Forms access key
- [ ] Update CORS origin in API route
- [ ] Enable HTTPS (automatic on Vercel)
- [ ] Review rate limits for your traffic
- [ ] Test forms with validation
- [ ] Check security headers are applied
- [ ] Verify environment variables are set
- [ ] Remove console.log statements (automatic in production)

## üîê Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
2. **Monitor Logs**: Check for suspicious patterns
3. **Test Security**: Use tools like:
   - [Security Headers](https://securityheaders.com/)
   - [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)
   - [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)
4. **Backup**: Regular backups of configuration
5. **Incident Response**: Have a plan for security incidents

## üÜò Emergency Response

If you suspect a security breach:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Check Vercel logs for suspicious activity
   - Review recent form submissions
   - Check for unauthorized changes

2. **Blocking Attackers**:
   - Add IPs to `BLOCKED_IPS` in `middleware.ts`
   - Increase rate limits temporarily
   - Enable additional validation

3. **Recovery**:
   - Rotate API keys
   - Review and clean data
   - Notify affected users if needed

## üìù Security Headers Report

Your site will score A+ on security header tests with:
- Strict transport security
- Content security policy
- XSS protection
- Frame options
- Content type options
- Referrer policy
- Permissions policy

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks:
- Review logs for anomalies
- Check rate limit effectiveness
- Monitor form submission patterns

### Monthly Tasks:
- Update dependencies
- Review security configuration
- Test all security features
- Run security scanning tools
